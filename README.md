## About

CineVerse is a feature-rich Flutter application that bridges the gap between cataloging databases and community networking, giving users a single place to discover, log, review, and organize cinema while engaging with a community of like-minded film and TV enthusiasts.

Rather than treating movie tracking and social interaction as separate concerns, CineVerse unifies them around a shared data model: a logged movie becomes a feed post, a review becomes a discussion thread, and a curated list becomes something to follow and share. The app is powered by The Movie Database (TMDB) for media metadata and integrates Google's Gemini models directly into the discovery experience, moving beyond simple keyword search toward mood-based and comparative recommendations.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

CineVerse uses a modern architecture optimized for scalability, clean state separation, and cross-platform performance.

### Core Architecture

- **Presentation Layer (Flutter)** — Declarative, reusable UI components styled with a customized Material Design theme.
- **State Management (Riverpod)** — `flutter_riverpod` ensures predictable, unidirectional state flows and decouples UI components from repository logic and caching.
- **Navigation (GoRouter)** — Declarative, URL-driven routing supporting nested and transition-friendly navigation paths.

### Backend Infrastructure (Firebase)

- **Firebase Authentication** — Secure user authentication supporting Email/Password login and Google Sign-In.
- **Cloud Firestore** — Real-time database for storing and synchronizing user profiles, social relationships, movie logs, custom lists, and review interactions.
- **Firebase Storage** — Secure media bucket hosting user-generated custom avatars.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** — Powers push notifications for social interactions, comments, and new followers.

### Data & Local Caching

- **Hive Database** — High-performance local storage for lightweight user settings, preferences, and onboarding flags.
- **TMDB API Integration** — Consumes REST endpoints from TMDB to deliver up-to-date, rich media metadata.
- **Google Generative AI SDK** — Interfaces directly with Google's Gemini models to handle complex NLP-driven requests, mood searches, and comparative analysis.
